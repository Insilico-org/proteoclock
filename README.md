ProteoClock is a Python package for analyzing and predicting biological age using proteomic data. This package implements various published proteomic aging clocks, allowing researchers to predict biological age from protein expression measurements.

## üß¨ Features

- **Multiple Clock Implementations**: Linear, Gompertz, and Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) based aging clocks
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools for handling protein expression data in various formats
- **Performance Analysis**: Utilities for evaluating and comparing clock performance
- **Visualization**: Functions for creating informative plots and visualizations

## üìã Implemented Clocks

The package currently implements the following published proteomic aging clocks:

1. Goeminne's 2025 **OrganAge**: ["Plasma protein-based organ-specific aging and mortality models unveil diseases as accelerated aging of organismal systems"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2024.10.005)
2. Kuo's 2024 PAC: ["Proteomic aging clock (PAC) predicts age-related outcomes in middle-aged and older adults"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.19.23300228)
3. Galkin's 2025 ipfP3GPT: ["AI-Driven Toolset for IPF and Aging Research Associates Lung Fibrosis with Accelerated Aging"](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.09.632065 )

The following proteomic clocks are comparable to the three above but require direct request sent to the authors:
1. Argintieri's 2024 **ProtAge**: ["Proteomic aging clock predicts mortality and risk of common age-related diseases in diverse populations"](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03164-7)
2. JDJ Han's 2025 proteomic clock: *paper in review*

## üöÄ Installation

### Using pip

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proteoclock.git
cd proteoclock

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

### Using conda

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proteoclock.git
cd proteoclock

# Create and activate conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate proteoclock

# Run this if you want to add the new env as a Jupyter Notebook kernel
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name proteoclock --display-name "proteoclock"

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

This library stores model weights across dozens of folders, so depending on your connection speed, loading it may take several minutes.

## üîç Quick Start

```python
# Import the necessary components
from proteoclock import ClockFactory, load_test_age_data, load_test_protein_data

# Load sample data
age_data = load_test_age_data()
protein_data = load_test_protein_data()

# Initialize clock factory
factory = ClockFactory()

# View available clocks
factory.view_clocks()

# Get a specific clock
goem_liver = factory.get_clock("goeminne_2025_full_chrono",
                              subtype="liver", 
                              scaler="goeminne_2025_full")

# Predict biological age
predictions = goem_liver.predict_age(protein_data, scaling='standard')
```

Once the models are loaded, the predictions are obtained in a matter of seconds for datasets containing <100 samples. 

Alternatively, try running the [demo notebook](https://github.com/Insilico-org/proteoclock/blob/main/notebooks/Demo%20Proteoclock.ipynb). If you get the same prediction as in the original demo everything works fine. Now, try replacing the default file paths to your own files and rerun the notebook to get the predictions for your own project. If any errors arise, check the following common issues:
- Is the data format correct? (see next section)
- Is the environment installed correctly? (specified library versions, Python 3.11)
- Are you trying to use the library w/out installing it via pip, e.g. for developing purposes? (you might need to update imports to relative statements)
- For deep clocks: Is the selected CUDA device available?

## üìä Data Format

ProteoClock expects protein data in long, tab-separated format with the following columns:
- `patient_id`: Identifier for each sample/patient
- `gene_symbol`: Protein/gene name
- `NPX`: Normalized Protein eXpression value

Example:

| patient_id | gene_symbol | NPX   |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| SAMPLE_001 | IL6         | 5.23  |
| SAMPLE_001 | TNF         | 4.87  |
| SAMPLE_002 | IL6         | 6.12  |
| SAMPLE_002 | TNF         | 5.34  |

See the [`test_data` folder](https://github.com/Insilico-org/proteoclock/tree/main/proteoclock/materials/test_data) for sample data.
Note that actual age values need to be provided in a separate file with matching `patiend_id` to carry statistical analytics downstream of age prediction.

## üìö Core Components

### Clock Implementations

All aging clock implementations inherit from the `BaseAgingClock` abstract base class.
All aging clock implementations inherit from the `BaseAgingClock` abstract base class, which provides common functionality for loading coefficients, handling scalers, and preprocessing data.

#### Clock Types

1. **LinearClock**: Simple regression-based clocks that directly predict age from protein measurements
2. **GompertzClock**: Based on mortality risk models like Kuo's 2024 PAC, using Gompertz distribution
3. **CPHClock**: Cox Proportional Hazards-based clocks that convert mortality risk to biological age
4. **DeepClock**: Neural network-based clocks for complex non-linear aging patterns (requires GPU)

#### Usage Example

```python
# Get a clock through the factory (recommended approach)
kuo_clock = factory.get_clock("kuo_2024", scaler="ukb_scaler")
predicted_ages = kuo_clock.predict_age(protein_data, scaling='standard')

# Or initialize directly
from proteoclock.clocks.simple_clocks import GompertzClock
gompertz_clock = GompertzClock(
    coef_file="path/to/coefficients.txt",
    scaler_file="path/to/scaler.pckl"
)
predicted_ages = gompertz_clock.predict_age(protein_data, age_data, scaling='standard')
```

### Utility Components

#### Data Preprocessing

The `OLINKScaler` class handles protein data preprocessing, including:

- Conversion between long and wide formats
- Imputation of missing values
- Data scaling

## üìÇ Project Structure

The package is organized into the following key directories:

- `proteoclock/clocks/`: Implementations of different clock types
- `proteoclock/data_preprocess/`: Data preprocessing utilities
- `proteoclock/materials/`: Model coefficients, scalers, and test data
- `notebooks/`: Example notebooks demonstrating package usage

For more details, see the README files in each directory.

## üìñ Documentation

For detailed usage examples, see the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, especially `Demo Proteoclock.ipynb`.

## üíæ System Requirements
Proteoclock was tested on Ubuntu 24 with Nvidia A10G

For package dependancies see [environment.yml](https://github.com/Insilico-org/proteoclock/blob/main/environment.yml).
For full support, you need to have a CUDA-enabled GPU, although GPU is not necessary to operate non-deep clocks.

The included deep clock's [weights ](https://github.com/Insilico-org/proteoclock/tree/main/proteoclock/materials/deep_clocks/galkin_2025) weights are only 20MB and shgould fit on most modern PCs with GPU cards.
